- IBM Cloud Resource Group
- Code Engine Project 
- Code Engine Secret 
- IBM Container Registry Namespace
- Code Engine Build (Docker image build from GitHub source)
- Code Engine Application (serverless container deployment with environment variables)

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**  

Start by cloning the repository that contains the Terraform configuration:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/agentic-iac-lab-materials
cd agentic-iac-lab-materials
```

2. **Configure Your Variables**  

Configure your variables in a `terraform.tfvars` file or via environment variables:  
- `ibmcloud_api_key` - Your IBM Cloud API key  
- `watsonx_project_id` - watsonx.ai project ID  

> ðŸ’¡ It's recommended to store sensitive values like `ibmcloud_api_key` securely and avoid committing them to version control.

3. **Initialize Terraform**  

Initialize the working directory to download required providers and modules:
```bash
terraform init
```

4. **Review the Execution Plan**  

Generate and review the Terraform plan to see what resources will be created or changed:
```bash
terraform plan
```

5. **Deploy Resources**:  

To apply the Terraform configuration and provision the required IBM Cloud resources, run:
```bash
terraform apply
```
âœ… When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the destruction of resources.

6. **Clean up and destroy resources**:  

To remove all provisioned IBM Cloud resources and clean up your environment, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
âœ… When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the destruction of resources.
