# Agentic IaC Lab Materials
This repository contains terraform-based automation to build, containerize, and deploy the Loan Risk AI Agents sample application on IBM Cloud using Code Engine and IBM Cloud terraform modules.

It serves as a complementary reference to the IBM Cloud TechXchange tutorial **Create and share secure Agentic AI solutions with Infrastructure-as-Code on IBM Cloud** available [here](https://ibm-cloud.github.io/techxchange-labs/agentic-1813/#/).

The tutorial provides an end-to-end walkthrough for building, deploying, and managing infrastructure automation for the **Loan Risk AI Agents** sample application using Terraform and IBM Cloud Code Engine. It covers both:
- **High-code approach**: Custom Terraform configurations leveraging terraform-ibm-modules for enterprise-grade IBM Cloud resources.
- **Low-code approach**: Composing and packaging deployable architectures for no-code, self-service deployment via IBM Cloud Catalog.

The core Terraform codebase referenced in the tutorial is maintained in the `agentic-iac-lab-materials` repository:

This repository is intended to extend, integrate, or orchestrate workflows based on that foundational infrastructure-as-code automation and deployable architecture.
